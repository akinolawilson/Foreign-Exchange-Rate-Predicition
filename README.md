# Statistical & Deep Learning: Foreign Exchange Rate Prediction Application


### Overview 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Machine learning has been applied to financial markets since the dawn of the computer age. The foreign exchange market in particular due to it's accessibility, liquidity and trading volume is a perfect contender to apply quantitative trading to. Bar weekends, trading in this market is conducted on a continuous basis all around the globe, leading to stable numerical data and low transaction fees in comparison to other markets such as the equity, fixed-income and derivatives market. 

### Purpose of Investigation 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
To demonstrate the feasiability of applying machine learning methods to the task of foreign exchange prediction, whilst ilustrating the entire lifecycle of producing such models. Hence, this repository contains the raw data used in this project, the data prepartion and cleaning, feature engineering and selection, training and testing of the models implemeneted in Python. The prepartion of data can be found in the _dataCleaningAndPreparing.py_ file, the training and testing in _trainingAndTest.py_ and the raw data files in _FXdataSet.zip_. 

### Prerequisites
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The packages needed to run these scripts are:-
* Pandas  
* Scikit-learn 
* Matplotlib 
* Numpy 
* Seaborn

### Methods
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Two non-parametric and parametric methods are compared and these are:-
<br>
#### Parametric:-<br>
* Elastic net regression <br>
* Ridge regression <br>
<br>
#### Non-parametric:-<br>
* Multi-layer preceptron regression <br>
* K-nearest neighbours regression <br>
